            <h2>About Albert Einstein</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the
                theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. He is widely considered to be one of the
                most influential scientists of the 20th century.</p>
            <p>Einstein is known for his famous equation E=mc², which describes the relationship between mass and
                energy. He was also a pacifist and civil rights activist, and spoke out against the use of nuclear
                weapons.</p>
